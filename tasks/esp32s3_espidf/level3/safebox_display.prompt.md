# safebox_display

Read keypad password 1234, drive relay on success, and display input/status on LCD1602. Use keypad rows GPIO 9,10,11,13, columns GPIO 14,12,43,44, relay GPIO 8, LCD RS 38, E 39, D4-D7 40,41,42,21.

Implement the solution as an ESP-IDF application for the ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1. Write C/C++ code for `main/main.c` with `void app_main(void)`. Use ESP-IDF driver APIs (`driver/gpio.h`, ADC one-shot, LEDC, I2C/SPI drivers, timers/FreeRTOS as appropriate) and `printf` for serial output. Do not use Arduino APIs or external Arduino libraries such as pinMode, digitalRead, digitalWrite, analogRead, Serial, delay, tone, Wire, SPI, LiquidCrystal, or Keypad.
