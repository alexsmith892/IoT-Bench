# rotary_encoder

Track position and rotation direction using the Rotary Encoder and print the current position and direction to the serial console. Use GPIO 43 for CLK and GPIO 44 for DT.

Implement the solution as an ESP-IDF application for the ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1. Write C/C++ code for `main/main.c` with `void app_main(void)`. Use ESP-IDF driver APIs (`driver/gpio.h`, ADC one-shot, LEDC, I2C/SPI drivers, timers/FreeRTOS as appropriate) and `printf` for serial output. Do not use Arduino APIs or external Arduino libraries such as pinMode, digitalRead, digitalWrite, analogRead, Serial, delay, tone, Wire, SPI, LiquidCrystal, or Keypad.
